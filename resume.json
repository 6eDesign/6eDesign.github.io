    "brief": "I am a fullstack web developer located in Thornton, Colorado.  I love architecting and building scalable, configuration-driven, web applicataions and frameworks with RESTful API's and JavaScript.  When writing my own API's and backend services, I prefer Node.js but also have some experience in PHP and Java (Spring).  I pride myself in writing 'vanilla' JavaScript that is lightweight and free of external dependencies but sometimes I like to play with Leaflet, D3.js, and Svelte and have some experience with many of the big libraries and frameworks.  I thoroughly enjoy working with teams of talented developers, peer-programming, and learning new techniques, languages, and libraries."
